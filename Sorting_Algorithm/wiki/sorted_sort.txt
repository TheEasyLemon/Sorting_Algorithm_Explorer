#SORTED SORT#

##Details##

The python **sorted()** function is built-in.

In Python 3.8.2, the syntax is:

`sorted(iterable, *, key=None, reverse=False)`

The built-in sorted() function is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal â€” this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes. (Python 3.8.2 Docs)

Generally, this is the &&fastest implemented sort&& that I've tested. According to the source code, the list.sort() method handles the sorting, which is interesting because sorted() somehow manages to perform faster (Lines 2226-2227 of cpython/Python/bltinmodule.c).
